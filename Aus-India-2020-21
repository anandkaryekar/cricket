Series Down Under Nov 2020 to Jan 2021

Reflections from the INCREDIBLE series win

For the starters this is one of the best victories for India. We had World Cup wins but the courage, belief, resilience and hard work, day in day out, for almost 18 to 19 playing days, makes this very special. Even the 2000-01 Kolkatta epic one starring VVS and Dravid, while as amazing as it was, was still with full strength team. Just because of the sheer odds stacked against a team, this is purely magical.

- This series, through unforeseen circumstances, in my opinion has shown that India needs to play an allrounder all the time, even if he is not yet a complete batsman or a bowler. Let them grown on the job. The balance and the cushion it provides for the bowlers is immense. Now with Jadeja, Sundar and Pandya there is a pipeline. This should end the "5 bowlers or 6 batsmen" debate.

- Also another great consideration is to rotate your fast bowlers in a 3 or more test series. With the amount of workload and schedule the bowlers go through, however good they are, fatigue is a real thing. Ask the Aussie bowlers.

- Continue and enhance the "A series" program. The gap between first class and international has been reduced dramatically because of the A series and having someone like Dravid lead it. The debutants now know how to absorb pressure, they have seen it, been there, played at these grounds, and got coached on mindset, approaches. IPL helped here as well, as the young ones rub shoulders with the greats and get to learn from them from very close. 

- Also covid constraints showed the value of practice matches and bigger squads. The 2 practice matches, which was impossible luxury before, provided the much needed acclimatization. In the past unfortunately acclimatization happened in the first set of tests. Also with bigger squads the bench got to immerse with the team all along rather than someone flying half the globe and thrusted into action right away.

- Test cricket can be very thrilling. An intense maiden at Gabba is as exciting as a Tewatia hitting 5 sixes in an over. The tactics and execution of skills, session after session, can be very absorbing. Lot of injuries could be attributed to non stop cricket from September. IPL is a cash cow, but Test cricket is pinnacle, can we ask for cash to not always trump pride (pls BCCI)...

- How important is the art of blocking and defense! Pujara absorbing 900 something balls this series (1200+ in the last) is immense in the context of taking on the new ball, tiring the attack, and paving way for Pant and Sundar to flourish. 

- Also let everyone play in their style and grow in it. Pujara was not asked to search for runs. The contrasting approaches does provide a balance. This was best exemplified by Pujara-Gill partnership. A learning for Kohli and management, yes Kohli's energy and enthusiasm rubs on everyone but approaches don't have to be singular which he terms as "intent". Taking on the body blows by Pujara, Ashwin, Vihari but staying stoic was equally critical for the outcome of the series. 

- I think this is a moment when the new age India has "pivoted" away from "fatalism". In the past with injuries and everything conspiring against you, the team would have easily disintegrated into giving-up but not this bunch. The last day at Gabba started with winviz showing 1% chance of Indian win. There was courage to look at opportunity to win instead of discretion to draw. In the end with 9 overs or so left and 50+ to get with Cummins steaming in with a new ball (he had taken 4 out of the 5 wickets then) I was hoping we don't go for a win so as to not create chances for Aus, but IPL-honed Pant and Sundar went for win and created HISTORY. 

- Lastly, everything may be stacked for you - home conditions, fitness, toss, history, best bowling attack - and you may still not get the result. 2 times in a row the best bowling attack didn't provide the expected outcome for Aus. As in life, Nothing is granted!
